# Testing Considerations

As features are developed, remember to consider testability:

-   **Unit Tests:** Are pure functions and logic isolated enough for unit testing (e.g., with Jest/Vitest)?
-   **Integration/Component Tests:** Can the component be tested in isolation, simulating user interactions (e.g., with React Testing Library)? Are elements easily selectable (e.g., using `data-testid`)?
-   **End-to-End Tests:** (If applicable) Does the feature require end-to-end testing (e.g., with Cypress/Playwright)?
-   **Mocking:** How will dependencies (API calls, modules) be mocked during tests?
