# Component Design Checklist

When designing or requesting new components/features, consider the following:

-   **State Management:**
    -   Where should the state live? (Local, Context, global store?)
    -   Is prop drilling becoming excessive?
    -   Is the state structure scalable?
-   **Data Fetching:**
    -   What is the data fetching strategy? (e.g., useEffect, React Query, SWR)
    -   How are loading and error states handled visually?
-   **Reusability:**
    -   Can this component be made more generic?
    -   Are props clearly defined and typed?
-   **Composition:**
    -   How does this component fit within the larger application structure?
    -   Does it follow separation of concerns?
-   **Edge Cases:**
    -   What happens with empty data, invalid inputs, or unexpected user interactions?
