# Performance Checklist

While prioritizing readability, keep performance in mind, especially for complex features:

-   **Re-renders:** Are components re-rendering unnecessarily? Consider `React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`.
-   **Bundle Size:** Are large libraries being imported? Could code splitting or dynamic imports (`React.lazy`) help?
-   **List Rendering:** Are keys used correctly for lists? Is virtualization needed for very long lists?
-   **Expensive Computations:** Are there heavy calculations happening on render? Can they be memoized or moved?
-   **Network Requests:** Are requests efficient? Is data being over-fetched?
