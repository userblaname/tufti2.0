  twoScreens: {
    title: "Two Screens",
    content: `We each have two screens of attention: inner (thoughts) and outer (environment). Being stuck on either is like being asleep, unable to control our reality. True awareness lies in the center point between them.`
  },
  strollThroughDream: {
    title: "A Stroll Through A Dream",
    content: `Practice being consciously aware ("awake") in daily life. Pay attention to your surroundings and yourself within them. This initial exercise reveals how others are "asleep" in their routines and how your awareness can influence interactions.`
  },
  firstEntryIntoReality: {
    title: "First Entry into Reality",
    content: `This walk of awareness is your first entry into true reality, not just the programmed script most people follow. By being awake, you can observe the script and its limitations, becoming a living character rather than a puppet.`
  },
  trackingAttention: {
    title: "Tracking Your Attention",
    content: `Your attention, like your soul, is usually not your own, directed by an external script. Track where your attention goes—inner or outer screen—to understand how the script controls you.`
  },
  composingReality: {
    title: "Composing Reality",
    content: `You can control the future frame of reality, not the current one. Use your intention, focused through the "plait" (an energy center), to imagine the desired outcome. Don't fight the current reality; shape the next one.`
  },
  intentionPlait: {
    title: "The Intention Plait",
    content: `The plait, an energy plexus extending from your spine, is your tool for influencing reality. By focusing your attention on the plait's tip and visualizing your desired outcome, you "illuminate" the future frame.`
  },
  workingWithPlait: {
    title: "How to Work with the Plait",
    content: `The plait has two centers: inner (everyday actions) and outer (shaping future reality). Learn to use the outer intention by visualizing your desired outcome while focusing on the plait, effectively "projecting" your desired future.`
  },
  illusionOfAction: {
    title: "The Illusion of Action",
    content: `We often mistake script-driven actions for free will. True action comes from composing reality ahead of time, not reacting within the current frame. Practice small "miracles" (e.g., finding a parking space) to build this skill.`
  },
  escapingTrap: {
    title: "How to Escape a Trap",
    content: `The "trap" is being a character in a pre-written script. Escape requires: 1) knowing you're a character, 2) breaking reflexive habits ("snail horns"), and 3) expanding your view of what's possible. Start composing your reality proactively.`
  },
  reprogramming: {
    title: "Reprogramming",
    content: `Replace reactive habits (waiting, hoping) with proactive composition. Practice visualizing successful outcomes for both likely and unlikely events to rewire your "snail mold" and accept the power of your will.`
  },
  transformation: {
    title: "Transformation",
    content: `By composing reality and yourself, you transform from a passive "snail" to a radiant "firefly." Illuminating the frame with positive intentions attracts desired events and inspires those around you.`
  },
  metaPower: {
    title: "Meta-Power",
    content: `Meta-power is the opposite of force, acting from "the other side of reality." Access it by using your plait, not by struggling within the current frame. Think of a mirror—influence the reflection (future) from beyond the glass (present).`
  },
  imitatingAction: {
    title: "Imitating Action",
    content: `You can't change the script directly, but you can "imitate" desired actions within it while subtly changing the film reel. This involves being present, observing the script's cues, and choosing actions that lead to a more favorable script.`
  },
  beingPresent: {
    title: "Being Present",
    content: `Presence is being consciously aware of yourself within the film of reality. It allows you to choose a different film roll (a new life script) by setting the goal frame, not by controlling individual events.`
  },
  advantage: {
    title: "Advantage",
    content: `Don't get trapped by negativity. Find the advantage in every situation, even "defeats." This allows the script to work for you by shifting you onto a more beneficial film roll.`
  },
  allowing: {
    title: "Allowing",
    content: `Let go of the need to control the script. Focus on the goal frame, and trust that the script will find a way to achieve it. Insisting on your own plan hinders the design.`
  },
  theScript: {
    title: "The Script",
    content: `Your job isn't to know "how" but to define "what" you want. Set the goal frame, and the script will find the path. When life feels like it's falling apart, it's often clearing the way for something better.`
  },
  creatorsSpark: {
    title: "The Creator's Spark",
    content: `We all have the potential to create our own reality, like the Creator, but we're often stuck in passive observation. Focus on self-development to ignite your creative spark and shape your reality.`
  },
  dictatesOfPower: {
    title: "Dictates of Power",
    content: `You have a choice: be propelled by the script or propel yourself. Self-development accelerates this process. True power comes from aligning with the "outer intention" accessed through the plait, not from forcing your will.`
  },
  following: {
    title: "Following",
    content: `Don't try to control events or people; follow the script's cues and sense the "decrees of Power" (intuitive nudges). This allows you to make use of the script's wisdom and move toward your goal effortlessly.`
  },
  outerPower: {
    title: "Outer Power",
    content: `Follow the decrees of Power (intuition, not whims). Disobedience to the script's subtle guidance leads to problems. Consciously allow the script to lead you, and you'll use its power to your advantage.`
  },
  paperPerson: {
    title: "Paper Person",
    content: `When unaware, we're like "paper people" in a book—flat characters following a predetermined path. Awakening and using intention give us depth and the ability to change the "book."`
  },
  composingImage: {
    title: "Composing the Image",
    content: `Reality mirrors our thoughts and actions. To get what you want, give what you want to receive (e.g., radiate love to receive love). Compose the image of your ideal self and interactions.`
  },
  communicatingMirror: {
    title: "Communicating with the Mirror",
    content: `Communicate with others through the mirror principle, not by trying to control them. Focus on giving what you want to receive, and be sensitive to their self-worth.`
  },
  manipulation: {
    title: "Manipulation",
    content: `You can manipulate reality, but not people. When composing your ideal reality, visualize abstract figures and avoid trying to control specific individuals. Focus on their importance and self-realisation.`
  },
  composingReflection: {
    title: "Composing the Reflection",
    content: `Reality is a three-dimensional mirror. "Fake it till you make it" by behaving as if you already have what you desire. Reality will align with your make-believe.`
  },
  fatalDilemma: {
    title: "Fatal Dilemma",
    content: `The fatal dilemma is being trapped in a negative feedback loop of thoughts and reality. Break free by composing a positive image, reflection, and reality.`
  },
  youAreAmazing: {
    title: "You Are Amazing",
    content: `You are a dual being, capable of being on both sides of the "mirror" of reality. Being present allows you to shift between film rolls (life scripts). Composing the film roll (not the script) is your power.`
  },
  youArePerfect: {
    title: "You Are Perfect",
    content: `Don't compare yourself to others' "norms." Embrace your uniqueness. Self-development, not self-criticism, is the key to unlocking your potential.`
  },
  threeAchievements: {
    title: "The Three Achievements Way",
    content: `1) Don't focus on shortcomings. 2) Have an inspiring goal. 3) Focus on self-development. This leads to a positive shift in reality, reveals your life purpose, and empowers you to achieve it.`
  },
  youAreBrilliant: {
    title: "You Are Brilliant",
    content: `You are inherently perfect because of the Creator's Spark within you. Focus on manifesting that brilliance through triple action (propelling reality, yourself, and yourself from within).`
  },
  thoughtForms: {
    title: "Thought Forms",
    content: `Thought forms are affirmations that try to convince. Thought markers are statements of fact based on observed results. Use the plait for both. Live your desired reality, don't just think about it.`
  },
  thoughtMarkers: {
    title: "Thought Markers",
    content: `The mind doesn't invent; it receives information and sets your condition (sense of self). Confirm positive shifts with thought markers to adjust your design and create a new reality.`
  },
  greedyCatchers: {
    title: "Greedy Catchers",
    content: `We are all "greedy catchers" of sensory experiences, grasping at the immediate rather than shaping the future. Shift from reactive to proactive composition using thought markers to consolidate gains and maintain momentum.`
  },
  sweetHarmony: {
    title: "Sweet Harmony",
    content: `Cultivate a state of "sweet harmony"—pleasure, peace, and love—within yourself and towards others. This attracts positive people and events, creating a benevolent reality.`
  },
  plaitWithThreads: {
    title: "Plait with Threads",
    content: `Sweet harmony is like controlling the weather of your reality. It's a deliberate choice, not dependent on external circumstances. Practice activating the plait and visualizing a state of sweet harmony.`
  },
  pastIncarnations: {
    title: "The Power of Past Incarnations",
    content: `You have access to the personal power accumulated throughout your past lives. Claim this power by declaring your right to it while using the plait.`
  },
  infinityInInfinity: {
    title: "Infinity in Infinity",
    content: `Reality is a part of infinity, constantly evolving. Don't overthink the "how"; focus on the "what" and experience the joy of creating your reality.`
  },
  conclusion: {
    title: "Conclusion",
    content: `Most people live unawakened, drifting through a pre-written film. Use the knowledge you've gained to become a conscious creator of your reality. Remember Tufti and don't forget yourself.`
  },
  methods: {
    title: "Methods",
    content: `This chapter summarizes the key practices: Awakening Method, Frame Illumination Method, Plait With Flow Method, Advantage Method, Following Method, Image Method, Reflection Method, Design Synchronisation Method, and Integrated Action-Stroll Method.`

  alternativesModel: {
    title: "The Alternatives Model",

  },
  pendulums: {
    title: "Pendulums",
